# Hoppie ACARS Documentation Project

## About
This is a project designed to capture all information related to the Hoppie ACARS System and document it. The two pieces of material I referred to the most are: [ICAO's Global Operation Link Document](https://www.icao.int/apac/documents/edocs/gold_2edition.pdf) & [FAA's Data Link Services Guidance Material](https://www.notams.faa.gov/downloads/CPDLC_ver_10.pdf)
